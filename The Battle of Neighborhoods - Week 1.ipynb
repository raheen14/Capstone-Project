Istanbul can be considered as the combination of the old and modern city, as well as a mixture of cultures in a captivating atmosphere. There are only few cities in the world that can be so delightful to experience and enjoy as Istanbul. Istanbul is considered to be the bridge that links Asia with Europe from a cultural and geographical standpoint.Istanbul offers an unforgettable experience for its travelers, with its colorful daily city life and dynamic nightlife. The beautiful silhouette of the city combines historical sites and monuments such as Roman aqueducts, Byzantine churches, Venetian towers, Ottoman palaces from the Byzantine, Ottoman and Turkish periods. \nIf I start writing about Istanbul, there will be no end to it as it offers so much to see and experience. Therefore, I will directly come to the point of discussion for the problem of this project.\n"

If you are in Istanbul, you are one step away from tasting the delicious meals of the Turkish cuisine. Istanbul offers a wide range of Turkish cuisine at the variety of well established, good and luxury Istanbul Restaurants.\n\nIn this project, I will be considering a problem to recommend places in Istanbul where a cafe or a restaurant can be opened. The interested party or the audience will be the entrepreneurs who want to set up their food chain in the marvelous city of Istanbul. The place can be a crowded one which is already considered a hub of cafes and restaurants or it can be a quiet place where not many entrepreneurs  have started cafes or restaurants yet. And this will be a good opportunity in my opinion so as to stand out from the rest.\n"
